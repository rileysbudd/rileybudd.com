    <p>Hey YC! if you're reading this it's because my personal website is still under development.</p>
    <p>For the sake of argument, it's a flask app behind gunicorn being served through nginx. All of that is dockerized and continuously deployed from a Github repo to GCP. There's some reverse-proxying out to external services as well.</p>
    <p>Also Michael Seibel, I am so sorry for how stupid I was in the two emails we exchanged back in 2017. I was a kindof a weird little shit at the time.</p>
